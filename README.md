# dexxOS
dexxos is currently a x86 32-bit operating system written from scratch.
The goal is a fast and low on system resources OS, while still being visually appealing, customizable, user friendly and powerful.
The OS will be modular which means that it and all its features are separate parts working together. so that a person can add or remove what they want. It will consist of a kernel that will deal with memory management and basic low-level functions that the OS's apps can call to perform there desired tasks like graphics, audio and more.
**all versions of dexxOS will be tested on real hardware because thats the point**
I try my best to make the code as simple and straight forward as possible so people can learn and understand it

## Current-State

 + bootloader
   + Enabling the A20 line
   + loading kernel with BIOS (16-bit)
   + Setup GDT (flat memory model) 
   + Switch To Protection Mode (32-bit)
   + Start Kernel
 + Kernel
   + Text Mode
   + Heap
   + Paging
   + Interrupts (Soon)
 + Drivers

### Requirements (Linux)
 - `sudo apt install make` (Build tool)
 - `sudo apt install nasm` (Assembler)
 - `sudo apt install qemu-system-x86` (Emulator)
 - `sudo apt install gcc` (Compiling C code)

### How to build
 - Install Requirements
 - Download the project
 - goto root directory with make file
 - run `make run` to build and run dexxOS
 - run `make clear` to remove all pre-built binary's for clean build
 - run `make` to just build without running

## End-Goal
 ![End-Goal](/images/dexxOS_goal.png)
### planned Beginning App's
 **[Desktop]** - displays the background image and allows positioning app's and folder's within the "Desktop" folder (without you get a black back)<br>
 **[menubar]** - A basic button at the bottom of the screen that displays the logo and when clicked a menu of tabs to launch applications<br>
 **[About]** - displays the operating system version (and other OS version info) (apps can check this version to verify they can run) (mainly for outdated versions)<br>
 **[Terminal]** - a text window for typing commands to directly use your pc (without GUI apps)<br>
 **[System Monitor]** displays memory and active processes, also allowing you to end them<br>
 **[Files]** - visually view files and create/edit/delete/move/rename them<br>
 **[Viewer]** - image viewer<br>
 **[Calculator]** - calculate numbers (+-รรท)<br>
 **[Defragmenter]** - when ever you write a file to disk the files memory may not be next to each other but scattered into multiple chunks this is called fragment data. This app defragments the data combining them all in 1 consecutive memory (increasing reading speed)<br>
